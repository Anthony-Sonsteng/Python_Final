# Python_Final

This code enables me to send a custom text message to a specified phone number at a specific number of seconds in the future


This python code takes ask for three inputs. Your desires message(message), the desired recipient(no_to), and how long you would like to delay the message in seconds(send_at). Then usues the twilio library to complete the function.

I used the datetime, and timedelta functions from the default library and client from the twilio.rest library
I created another .py file to private information reguarding my personal phone number and and twilio account information

The function uses three raw_inputs for the three arguments.
